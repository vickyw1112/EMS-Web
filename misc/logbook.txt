We did requirement analysis together and have our first version of user stories ready.
We'll probably fix some issues in the user stories and prepare some draft CRC cards for next meeting to finalise a class diagram
Obstacles include not having idea about what to write in most of the goal field of RGB user story.

We formalised user stories, added Acceptance Criteria and Priority for each user story. Still figuring out what should we put after 'so that'.
We also write detailed class specifications including each class's properties and methods from our draft CRC cards.
We decide to do a digital class diagram from these hand-wrriten specifications on Wednesday's lab session and also to seek further clarifications about user stories from tutors.

We got our feedback about user stories and class diagram from our tutor, and finalised everything on class diagram.
We prepare to do first iteration of our project within next week which include the first two user stories with priority 1.
We will have a meeting next week to merge our code and do the testing together to finish iteration 1.
We will settle who to do what later and added below 

class/methods to be implemented for iteration1:

Vicky:
    EMS:
    EMS.loadUsers
    EMS.addUser
    EMS.login
    EMS.getUserById
    EMS.getOpenEventsByCategory
    EMS.getEventById

    User:
    property getters
    User.__init__
    User.get_id

==============================

We worked on some obstables that we've encountered in our own separate works together and then merged all of our codes back to master branch.
Fixed quite a lot small bugs and got first iteration running.
There're still some unit tests to be written, but overall, functionality for iteration 1 user stories is all good.
We'll do some maintenance jobs and then decide some details about next iteration.
